# Updated Battle Simulator

## Project Description
---
This program's purpose is to let the user have fun battling or doing other things as RPG characters they create. The options that the user is given for their characters and the program are create, display, stat visual, data analysis, remove, battle, shop, equip, and exit. Each character has a name, class, level, items and stats. When creating and setting this information, you can get a randomly generated character description for inspiration. Using the display option lets the user see all of the info for the characters that have been created. The visuals option shows a characters stats in a separate window witha graph. You can also get a data analysis of the character, fight and shop as a character, or equip a weapon you get from the shop. Battles are between two of the created characters and is central to the idea of this project.

## Author's Information
---
The author of this project is Luke Murdock and he is a student at UCAS, currently taking a programming class and creating projects like this one to help him learn python and the basics of programming. He mostly enjoys coding, expecially when it doesn't have many bugs and has a fun end product. He enjoys lots of other things including reading and playing games, including video games. He thinks it would be fun to eventually make some sort of actual game in the future if he ever gets the oppurtunity.
